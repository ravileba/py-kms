## How to Find Your NVivo 11 License Key
 
There are different ways to find your NVivo 11 license key depending on how you purchased the software:
 
- If you bought NVivo 11 online from QSR International, you should have received a welcome email with your license key and download instructions.
- If you bought NVivo 11 from a reseller or distributor, you should have received a confirmation email or a physical package with your license key and installation media.
- If you are using an enterprise license (formerly known as site license) provided by your organization, you should contact your IT administrator or NVivo coordinator for your license key.
- If you already have NVivo 11 installed on your computer, you can retrieve your license key from the software. On Windows, click File > Help > About NVivo. On Mac, click NVivo > About NVivo. Note that only the first 20 characters of the license key are displayed in the About screen[^2^].
